ImageJ Legacy Bridge
--------------------

The legacy component enables backward compatibility between
[ImageJ2](https://github.com/imagej/imagej2) and
[ImageJ 1.x](https://github.com/imagej/ImageJ).

It contains the code necessary to translate ImageJ2 images into the original
ImageJ (1.x) format and back, so that legacy plugins can execute faithfully.
